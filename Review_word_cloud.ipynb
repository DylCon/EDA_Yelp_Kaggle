My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because of our waitress. We had a large party, and had warned her we would be splitting the tab... She said, \"no problem, I\\'ll print multiple receipts so everyone can circle what they had.\" So we do this, and she cops major attitude because we gave her 5 cards (NOTE: I know this is annoying for a server, but she said it was fine when asked about it).

       "       'I decided to get my family some quick lunch and ice cream for my little brother and niece,  we waited over 5 minutes in the drive through with not a word being said to us before deciding to just go in, where again it took almost 5 minutes to be acknowledged while standing at the register, just for the ice cream I had ordered a strawberry cheesecake blizzard, a banana split blizzard, a medium dipped cone, and a kids cone. The two blizzards came out first, I had looked at the cheesecake blizzard and it looked more like a milk shake, my little brother saw the multiple advertised pictures of blizzards upside down, decided to turn his upside down, immediately upon doing so the entire thing poured out onto the table. I told him to go tell the girl at the front, and they will make him a new one, considering that they advertise, \"upside down or it\\'s free,\" the girl at the counter looked like she had no clue what was going on, she literally put her hands up and shook her head back and forth and said, \"I don\\'t know\" another lady came up (I\\'m assuming was a manager, she was black, older, very short hair cut, with thick drawn on eyebrows and bright yellow acrylic nails) and asked what the problem was, I explained how my little brothers blizzard fell all over the the table when he attempted to turn it over, she asked what kind it was and I told her, and she proceeded to tell me it was whoever had made its fault, and turned and walked away. I figured that they were going to make him a new one because why else would she just randomly leave in the middle of talking to me other than to fix the problem? After a few minutes I waited and asked if they were remaking it, I was told no and then asked if I could get my money back, which of course was another ordeal in itself. The girl at the front told me that she was just an employee and couldn\\'t help me, so I asked if someone was available that could. She said yes, and put two bags on the counter and said \"oh here\\'s your food by the way.\" Which I won\\'t even get into how wrong that came out. Finally the same woman I spoke to earlier came back out and looked at me and angrily said. \"so what are you doing here?\" Her attitude astounded me, the least you could do is seem like you cared in the least about guest service. Anyway eventually she refunds me the money I paid for the blizzard, and when she hands my the receipt I said thank you, which she then replied with a very bitchy, \"No.\" I get that it\\'s fast food and you can\\'t really expect great service, but honestly, how do you get into a management position when you treat people like they\\'re shit? Not once did anyone say I\\'m sorry, or that they\\'ll attempt to fix anything. I understand it\\'s stupid to turn your ice cream upside down, but don\\'t advertise upside down or it\\'s free and then refuse to remedy the problem when a young child turns his cup upside down. My family and I will never be returning to this or any DQ location.',\n",

One lady asked for a refund because she waited 30 mins to get ONE burger. They gave her the refund. The other lady is STILL waiting. No sure how long she was there. Finally the manager Manny took our order. He actually rolled his eyes at US for our choices that we put on our burger. I got my receipt, and looked at it and it turns out my order was wrong. I told him I didn\\'t order an egg on my burger (which cost $2.00 to add on btw) He didn\\'t offer a refund or anything, nor an apology. Finally, the other lady who was STILL waiting got her food gets her order. And guess what?! HER food was wrong too! They messed up 3 orders back to back, so I requested a refund. I ended up waiting for almost 30 mins as well. The manager then says I am waiting because my \"burger has an egg on it,\" which I already told him that was incorrect. The girl in the back named Brittany started laughing. I told her it\\'s not funny that you all have messed up 4 peoples food back to back and my total was $26.00. I actually have called Fatburger Corp. and spoke to the VP of Operations regarding this. I encouraged him to look at this yelp page to see how his store is doing.',\n",
